# Improved Stock Price Trend Prediction with Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine and Ensemble Learning through a Voting Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a stock price prediction model that leverages an ensemble learning approach, combining Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is designed to predict stock price movements based on historical data and various technical indicators.

## Features

1. Implements ensemble learning using a Voting Classifier that combines Random Forest and SVM.
2. Uses technical indicators as features for improved accuracy.
3. Supports data preprocessing, including missing value handling and feature scaling.
4. Includes backtesting for performance evaluation.
5. Easy to use with well-structured code and modular implementation.
